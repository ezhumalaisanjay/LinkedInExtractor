# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide for AI Website Scraper

## 📋 What's Been Set Up

Your application is now ready for Netlify deployment with:

✅ **Netlify Configuration** (`netlify.toml`)
- Automatic builds and redirects configured
- Serverless functions setup for the backend API
- Static frontend hosting

✅ **Serverless Backend** (`netlify/functions/analyze.js`)
- Website scraping functionality using fetch + cheerio
- Content extraction for homepage, contact info, and social media
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- No database dependencies (works entirely serverless)

✅ **Frontend Updates**
- Automatic API routing (Netlify functions in production, local server in development)
- Responsive design optimized for static hosting
- All assets bundled for optimal performance

## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Select your repository

### 2. Configure Build Settings
Netlify will automatically detect the settings from `netlify.toml`, but verify:
- **Base directory**: Leave empty (root)
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`

### 3. Set Environment Variables (Optional)
In Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key (for AI summaries)

### 4. Deploy
Click "Deploy site" - Netlify will:
- Install dependencies
- Build the frontend
- Deploy serverless functions
- Provide you with a live URL (e.g., `yourapp.netlify.app`)

## 🔧 How It Works

**Frontend (Static)**:
- React app served from Netlify's global CDN
- Optimized for fast loading worldwide
- Automatic HTTPS and custom domain support

**Backend (Serverless)**:
- `/api/analyze` endpoint runs as a Netlify function
- Scales automatically with usage
- No server maintenance required

**Features Available**:
- ✅ Website content extraction (title, meta, headings)
- ✅ Contact information detection (emails, phones)
- ✅ Social media link discovery
- ✅ Responsive, modern UI
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ AI-powered summaries (when API key provided)
